# Development with Large Language Models

This repository contains projects on LLMs developement.
We will use tools like OpenAI API, Langchain, Agents and ChromaDB

For the framework that handle the backend and the frontend. 
We use Chainlit which is  an open-source Python package that makes it incredibly fast to build and share LLM apps.

To run a file. Use the following command:

```
$ chainlit run main.py -w
```
